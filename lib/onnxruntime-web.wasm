This is a placeholder file for onnxruntime-web.wasm

In a real implementation, this would be the WebAssembly binary file from ONNX Runtime.

To get the real file:
1. Download from: https://www.npmjs.com/package/onnxruntime-web
2. Or use: npm install onnxruntime-web
3. Copy the .wasm file from node_modules/onnxruntime-web/dist/

For testing purposes, the mock JavaScript implementation will work without this file.
