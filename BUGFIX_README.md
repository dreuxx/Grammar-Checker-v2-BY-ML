# Grammar Checker Extension - Bug Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### üêõ Critical Runtime Errors Fixed:

1. **Missing `getSuggestions` method** in `background/service-worker.js`
   - **Problem**: The service worker was calling a method that didn't exist
   - **Fix**: Added the missing method to handle suggestion requests

2. **Null reference errors in content scripts**
   - **Problem**: Content scripts tried to access `this.settings.sites.disabled` without checking if settings loaded
   - **Fix**: Added safe property access with optional chaining (`?.`) and default values

3. **No error handling for settings loading**
   - **Problem**: If the background script failed to respond, content scripts would crash
   - **Fix**: Added try/catch blocks and fallback to default settings

4. **Service worker not loading stored settings**
   - **Problem**: The extension would always use default settings instead of user preferences
   - **Fix**: Added `loadStoredSettings()` method to load persisted settings on startup

5. **Popup crashes when tab URL is invalid**
   - **Problem**: Popup would fail if it couldn't parse the current tab's URL
   - **Fix**: Added error handling with default values

## Files Modified:

- `background/service-worker.js`: Added missing methods and settings loading
- `content/content-main.js`: Added error handling and safe property access
- `popup/popup.js`: Added error handling for state loading

## Debugging Tips:

1. **Check Chrome DevTools**:

   - Check "Errors" tab for any extension-specific issues

2. **Content Script Debugging**:

## Next Steps:

The extension should now load and function properly. The main grammar checking functionality depends on the ML model loading correctly, which may take some time on first install.

If you're still experiencing issues, check:
1. Chrome extensions page for any error messages
2. Console logs in the background script
3. Network tab for any failed resource loads
4. Permissions tab to ensure all required permissions are granted
